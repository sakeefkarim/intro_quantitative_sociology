# Questions

# 1. What are the differences between the three histograms/their underlying code?


# 2. What other questions can we ask (or visually explore) using `penguins`?


# THE GRAMMAR OF ggplot2 -------------------------------------------------------

# AESTHETICS -------------------------------------------------------------------

?aes

skim(gapminder)

# First example: gapminder

# No mapping aesthetics:

ggplot(data = gapminder)

# + positional aesthetics:

ggplot(data = gapminder,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))


# The code for this workshop is verbose by design, but you do not *have* to 
# spell out `mapping` and `data` each time you generate a plot. For instance, 
# you can produce the graphic by running:

ggplot(gapminder,
       aes(year, lifeExp))


# GEOMS ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# All the base geoms:

ls(pattern = '^geom_', env = as.environment('package:ggplot2'))

# Scatterplots -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Focus: relationship between the log of GDP per capita and life expectancy
# in gapminder. 


# To make matters easier, we'll home-in on the latest year included 
# in `gapminder` (2007). 

ggplot(# Note that we're subsetting the data within the ggplot function:
       data = gapminder |> filter(year == max(year)),
       # Here, we're mapping variables in our data to
       # the 'x' and 'y' positions in our plot space:
       mapping = aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
       geom_point(# Adjusts the colour of the points:
                  colour = "#008080",
                  # Adjusts the size of the points:
                  size = 1,
                  # Adjusts the transparency of the points:
                  alpha = 0.5)

# In the plot above, we've _added_ a geometric object (points or circles) to our
# graphic by including the `+ geom_point()` argument. 

# We can now tune or modify the aesthetic attributes of our `geom_point()` layer. 

# For instance, we can adjust `colour` within our global `aes` function to
# ensure that points are shaded pursuant to the `continent` variable in our data:

ggplot(data = gapminder |> filter(year == max(year)),
       mapping = aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp,
                     # Sets colour globally --- mapping it to the
                     # `continent` variable in the data.
                     colour = continent)) +
      geom_point( # Adjusts the size of the points:
                  size = 3,
                  # Adjusts the transparency of the points:
                  alpha = 0.5)


# We can also systematically adjust the *size* of our points. Below,
# the size of the points corresponds to a country's population in 2007 (logged).

ggplot(data = gapminder |> filter(year == max(year)),
       mapping = aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp,
                     colour = continent,
                     # Sets "size" globally -- mapping it to the
                     # population variable in the data.
                     size = log(pop))) +
geom_point(# Adjusts the transparency of the points:
           alpha = 0.5)


# Question

# How can we adjust the `shape` of the points in our plot to ensure that they 
# vary as a function of our `continent` variable?

# Scroll down for the answer:





# Answer:


ggplot(data = gapminder |> filter(year == max(year)),
       mapping = aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp,
                     colour = continent,
                     # Include the shape attribute in your aes() call:
                     shape = continent,
                     size = log(pop))) +
geom_point(# Adjusts the transparency of the points:
           alpha = 0.5)


# Line Plots -------------------------------------------------------------------

# Let's play around with some of the other data we have at our disposal ---
# specifically, data from `select_countries`.

# Here's an overview of the data frame:

select_countries

dfSummary(select_countries) |> view()

# Let's say we want to visualize how old-age dependency (`age_dependency`) has
# evolved over time for each of the nation-states (Canada, the United States,
# Germany, Japan) featured in our data. 

# To kick things off, let's produce a rudimentary plot that makes use of the `
# geom_line()` function.

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       aes(x = year, y = age_dependency,
           # This ensures that we produce unique lines for each country.
           group = country)) +
geom_line(colour = "dodgerblue",
          linetype = "dashed")


# Here's what would happen if we didn't modify the `group` aesthetic.

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       aes(x = year, y = age_dependency)) +
geom_line(colour = "dodgerblue",
          linetype = "dashed")


# We've produced four unique trajectories, but we don't know what these 
# trajectories mean.

# What can we do about it?

# Scroll down for the answer!










# Answer

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       aes(x = year, y = age_dependency, 
           # Sets colour to country:
           colour = country)) +
geom_line(linetype = "dashed")


# We can also ensure that our `linetype`s vary as a function of the `country`
# variable: 

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       aes(x = year, y = age_dependency, 
           colour = country,
           # Sets linetype to country as well:
           linetype = country)) +
  geom_line()


# Question 

# How can we adjust the `linewidth` of the trajectories in our plot to ensure 
# that they vary as a function of our `fertility_rate` variable? 

# For this exercise, do not include a `linetype` argument in your `aes()` call.
# Scroll down for the answer.










# Answer

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       aes(x = year, y = age_dependency, 
           colour = country,
           # Ensures that the width of the line varies by TFR:
           linewidth = fertility_rate)) +
  geom_line()

# Bar Plots --------------------------------------------------------------------

# To produce a few basic bar plots in `ggplot2`, let's use the 
# `select_countries_sex` data frame. 

# Here's a look at the data frame in question.

select_countries_sex

skim(select_countries_sex)

# For now, let's begin by producing a bar plot that highlights sex differences 
# in life expectancy in Canada, the United States, Germany and Japan in the 
# year 2020.

ggplot(data = select_countries_sex |> filter(year == max(year)),
       mapping = aes(x = country, y = life_expectancy,
                     # To produce different quantities along 
                     # the lines of sex:
                     group = sex)) +
geom_col(# To ensure that bars are placed
         # side-by-side --- and not stacked!
          position = "dodge", 
          colour = "white") 

?position_dodge()

# Here's what would happen if our `position` argument was left alone.

ggplot(select_countries_sex |>
         filter(year ==
                  max(year)),
       aes(x = country, 
           y = life_expectancy,
           group = sex)) +
  geom_col(colour = "white") 

# Now, let's clarify what the two bars (per country) actually represent. 

# How can we do this in a straightforward manner? 

# A simple approach is shown below: here, we simply change the `fill` of our 
# bars so they correspond to the `sex` variable in our input data:

ggplot(data = select_countries_sex |> filter(year == max(year)),
       mapping = aes(x = country,
                     y = life_expectancy,
                     # Ensuring that the colour inside the bars
                     #  (the "fill") varies by sex:
                     fill = sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", 
           colour = "white")

# Let's add a bit more complexity. To do so, we'll produce a graph that:

# 1. Reproduces the bar plot from above --- which illustrates sex differences in
#    life expectancy across four countries in the year 2020.

# 2. Displays the *distribution* of life expectancy for "females"/"males" across 
#    these 4 countries in the last half century (1970-2020). 

# Adding geoms -----------------------------------------------------------------

ggplot(data = select_countries_sex |> filter(year == max(year)),
       mapping = aes(x = country, y = life_expectancy,
                     fill = sex)) +
  geom_col(# Allows for more fine-grained control of
    # the space between bars:
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), 
    colour = "white") +
  geom_boxplot(linewidth = 0.3,
               width = 0.35,
               # Space between boxplots constrained to
               # be equal to space between bars:
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
               # Using original data frame that
               # has not been subsetted.
               data = select_countries_sex)

ggplot(data = select_countries_sex |> 
         filter(year == max(year)) |> 
         # Rearranging the order of the discrete 
         # y-axis labels using forcats functions:
         mutate(country = 
                  fct_rev(fct_relevel(country, 
                                      "Canada",
                                      "United States",
                                      "Germany"))),
       mapping = aes(# Note the inversion of the x and y axes:
         x = life_expectancy,
         y = country,
         fill = sex)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", 
           colour = "white") 


# What do you notice about the arguments within the `geom_boxplot()` function?

# STATISTICAL TRANSFORMATIONS --------------------------------------------------

# *Most* of the plots covered thus far feature an explicit mapping of variables
# to visuals. However, many of the `geom`s available in `ggplot2` feature 
# statistical transformations of the inputs to ease interpretation of the 
# relationships between variables in our data. 

# For our purposes, we'll focus on a couple of statistical transformations and a
# associated functions. To this end, we'll work with some new `geom`s that are 
# powered by `stat_*` functions under the hood.

# Smoothed Conditional Means ---------------------------------------------------

# We'll begin by visualizing how the fertility rate has evolved over time in 
# Canada, the United States, Germany and Japan. 

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = fertility_rate, 
                     colour = country)) +
  geom_line()

# The plot below uses `geom_smooth()` to simplify the same trends we encountered 
# above. 

# The function is powered by `stat_smooth()` under the hood, which (by default) 
# uses local polynomial regressions or general additive models.

       mapping = aes(x = year, y = fertility_rate,

                aes(fill = country),
              alpha = 0.3)

?geom_smooth

# We can adjust how we're "smoothing" our data by toggling the `method` 
# argument within `geom_smooth()`. 

# Here's how to generate estimates from a linear model (in lieu of the default
# non-parametric approaches),

ggplot(data = select_countries,
       aes(x = year,
           y = fertility_rate, 
           colour = country)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(fill = country),
